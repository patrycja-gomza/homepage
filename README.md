## General Info
My website is organized into the following four sections guided by navigation: about me, projects, my professional goals, hobbies. In addition to text, the content of the sections uses images, tables and links. The website also has three button-controlled actions: change header color, delete image, change background color. 
## Technologies
Project is created with:
- BEM
- JavaScript ES6+ Features
## Status
The site is dynamically growing, along with the new front-end programming skills I'm learning.
## Inspiration
This website is inspired by the course "Frontend Developer from the Basics" by the online programming school YouCode.
